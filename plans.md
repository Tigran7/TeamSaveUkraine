## Project Description
- Our project idea is to create an effective real estate website for Antonia Bokelman. Antonia Bokelman is a real estate agent who currently owns a website but it is currently lacking in professionalism and functionality, because of this she is having trouble with converting website visitors into clients. Our team reached out to her and she decided to sponsor us and gave us multiple components she wants implemented into her website. We are taking these requests into consideration and helping her design a sophisticated and functional website. This website displays high levels of professionalism and will have many user friendly features. Our goal is to have a higher engagement and contact rate through our website we are creating.
